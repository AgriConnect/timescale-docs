# Getting started with TimescaleDB

**Congratulations!!** You're ready to jump in and start using TimescaleDB. Smart
move! 

In this section of the TimescaleDB documentation, our goal is to get you into
data as quickly as possible. Once you've had your first experience with all
of the major features of TimescaleDB, there are a host of other more detailed
tutorials to help you dig into more specific use cases and datasets.

Remember, TimescaleDB is built on top of PostgreSQL, so any tools that can connect
to and use PostgreSQL, can connect to TimescaleDB. ðŸŽ‰
